For what I can do here tomorrow on Wednesday Aug 23 my friend had suggested that I go and run the terminal commands on mac that is an ASCII art representation of Star Wars, in this I can see if I can make a virtual terminal console within the browser. My initial hump is that I might have to end up a very extended gif in order to render out the visiion. The excited theory heading into this is that I can find a way to run a mac terminal through the browser using javascript. In furthering this idea there may be API's that can be used to build and run this terminal. I can internally store these ASCII characters but do not know the size of currently.
